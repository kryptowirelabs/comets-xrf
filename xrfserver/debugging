pistache/optinal.h is not found --> Removing it causes some of the templates to not be included

Next things to do 02/22/2022:
try to fix the Pistache::Optional objects. This is casued by the way OpenApi specifications are detailed. xAppDiscInst and InitAuthReqest need to be modified

It might have to do with the application/json vs www-url-encoded requestBody. For some reason in application/json request body, it is perceiving some of the parameters as Optional parameters

Make sure to change the <custom>request parameter in the api folder for all the auto-generated files. Some constructors also change as a result of this

The constructor of the impl needs to be modified

The api/.h files need to be modified to take in a Pistache object in the last function

For the xAppDiscover, the model/Helpers need to be overloaded with the new fromStringValue functions

In the impl/ files, the constructor needs to take in the main class object
